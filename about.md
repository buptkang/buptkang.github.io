My research area is in the intersection between Human Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly interested in developing learning systems to improve the human learning experience. I am also interested in modeling and diagnosing user perceptions toward the learning goal. I received BS in Computer Science/ Software Engineering from Beijing University Of Posts and Telecommunication. I got my master in computer science from University of Central Florida. My master thesis was focus on developing an sketch-based demonstration program to help students understand knowledge representations of Boolean algebra.

<br><br>

The goal of my Ph.D is developing an intelligent tutoring system to let students understand analytical geometry, the core concept to unify the geometric conceptual understanding and the algebraic procedural development. Currently, I am building the Bayesian-based adaptation method to diagnose studentsâ€™ understanding so as to tackle the learning uncertainty.
