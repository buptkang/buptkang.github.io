[Shirtless and Dangerous: Quantifying Linguistic Signals of Gender Bias in an Online Fiction Writing Community]
(http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08832)

The interesting finding is that despite women often being the target of negative stereotypes, female authors are equally likely to write such stereotypes as men.
