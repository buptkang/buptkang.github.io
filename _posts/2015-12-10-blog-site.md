title: HCI and Machine Learning a harmonious relationship
---

Machine learning is one of the core topic in the computer science, which analyzes data, builds model by learning and finally infers or makes the decision using new data set. Human Computer Interaction is another research field, which designs the system, build the system, evaluate the system by conducting well-designed experimental and conduct the data analysis in the end.

Both fields requires data understanding and corresponding analysis, **what is difference between the method in HCI differs in comparison to approaches in machine learning side?** My short answer is the HCI research mainly conduct the exploratory data analysis whereas the machine learning research mainly do the confirmative data analysis.

#### CDA versus EDA

For the confirmatory data analysis (CDA), people focus on conducting the inferential statistics through the deductive reasoning. Researchers create probabilistic model, accept the untestable assumptions, look for definite answers to specific questions. They emphasizes on the numerical calculations, and test their hypothesis through the pre-defined model using hypothesis testing methods. That is the pipeline machine learning researchers normally follows with.

For the exploratory data analysis (EDA), people relies on the descriptive statistics through the inductive reasoning. Researchers look for flexible ways to examine data without preconceptions, attempt to evaluate validity of assumptions through different statistical testing such as t-test one tail, analysis of variance, multivariate analysis of covariance and etc. People are heavily stick on the graphical display of the data and let data indicate further questions or findings.

The advantage of CDA is to provide precise information in the right circumstances, the model is built by using Well-established theory and methods. However, the disadvantage of it is misleading impression of precision in less than ideal circumstances. The data analysis is driven by preconceived ideas. It is difficult to notice unexpected results.

The advantage of EDA is its flexibility to generate hypotheses. It does not require more than data to support its hypothesis. The method may lead researchers to deep understanding of processes. However, the disadvantage of EDA is that it does not provide definite answers, it is difficult to avoid optimistic bias produced by overfitting. Sometimes, this method requires judgement and artistry.

From wikipedia of exploratory data analysis, EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. The goal of exploratory data analysis is to obtain confidence in your data to a point where you’re ready to engage a machine learning algorithm.

From the above higher-level understanding, exploratory data analysis do not conflict with the confirmative data analysis, we need both to understand data both in the breadth and the depth degree.

#### HCI versus Machine Learning

**How do the above two data analysis approaches affect HCI and Machine Learning research fields?**

In the machine learning fields, big data normally binds with clear definitions with different applied requirements. For instance, pixels in the image are data, which specifies its syntax and semantic; word in the language sentences are data, which specifies its syntax and semantic; gene in the cell are data, which specifies its syntax and semantic. With the confirmatory requirement, researchers use their talent to dive deeper to discover the accurate answer by using the confirmatory data analysis approach.

In the human computer interaction fields, data do not come in the air, it comes from the design and implementation of system prototype. For instance, an eye tracking application with the learning purpose captures data from users about their eye activities in different dimensions, such as fixation time, fixation area and moving frequency; an online web service captures kids’ online activities to talk with their mates about school homework experience. Since such design is tied with the unclear applied requirement, captured data mostly contains huge amount of information. Researchers need to explore such data in a coarse-grained manner first using the EDA approach creatively. The findings from data can further improve the user requirement, the system design or pass to the next-stage data analysis by collaborating with researchers from the machine learning field.

#### Conclusion

When I was learning computer science by reading the well-known book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Gerald Jay Sussman, Hal Abelson, I was impressed by the notion of interchangeable between data and procedure. In a more non computer science way, it is a chicken-egg process. Data relies on procedure; Procedure creates data.

Making a rational analogy, I do believe:

**_CDA needs EDA to elicit the requirement and refine data. EDA needs CDA to inform their precise discovery and well-defined model. In a such harmonious environment, people with different learning and research styles (EDA or CDA) can work together to build more usable and reliable systems to support humanity._**
