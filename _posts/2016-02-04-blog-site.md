title: Injecting Statistic into Logic as a Combinatoric Problem (1)
---

In the computer science undergraduate level, logic and data structure are the two main blocks that are taught. Here is the list of logic blocks:

1. Condition
2. Loops and Iteration
3. Recursion

By doing a combination among these three blocks, math & computer scientists invented more advanced logic blocks:

4. Greedy (Forward: Recursion + Condition)
5. Backtracking (Forward and Backward: Recursion + Condition)

The structure blocks can be categorized into different dimensions.  

+ One dimension (array, list, hashtable)
+ Two dimension (tree, graph, matrix)
+ High dimension (vertex-based for computer graphics, or even higher)

By fusing logic blocks and structure blocks, more logic blocks have been invented:

7. Divide & Conquer: (Recursion upon structure)
8. Dynamic Programming: (Recursion + re-use of augmenting structure)

In the high school and further undergraduate level math and statistic learning, we have learnt the following math blocks:

1. Arithmetic 
2. Algebraic
3. Geometric
4. Counting, Probability and Statistic
5. Function (calculus, numerical analysis and other advanced math courses)
