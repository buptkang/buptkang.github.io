title: Injecting Statistic into Logic as a Combinatoric Problem (2)

```python

def fib_divide_conquer(n):
    if n < 3 : return 1
    else:
        return fib_divide_conquer(n-1) + fib_divide_conquer(n-2)
```

Dynamic programming (DP) further solve problems with overlapping subproblems. Each sub-problem is solved only once and the result of each sub-problem is stored using additional space or memory. From computing view, **DP = recursion + re-use**


```python
mydict = {}

def fib_dp(n):
    if n in mydict:
        return mydict[n]
    else:
        if n < 2:
            f = 1
        else:
            f = fib_dp(n-1) + fib_dp(n-2)
        mydict[n] = f
        return mydict[n]
```
When analyzing the above logical spaghetti (formally called algorithm), we got : $$T(n)=T(n-1)+O(1)=O(n) $$

is beauty?


Bayesian inference is simply updating your beliefs after considering new evidence.
